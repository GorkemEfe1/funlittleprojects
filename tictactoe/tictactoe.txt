logic of tic tac toe
nine spaces, 3x3 grid first to match 3 in vertical, horizontal or diagonal

Opinion 1: We can give each grid its number and print out that when prompted by the user
At the start:
###    ###    ###    ### 
### to ##X to ##X to #OX
###    ###    ###    ### 
First print out a 3x3 hastag and prompt user 1 to enter then print out what the user entered then prompt user 2. Victory condition will be checked each round before either player is prompted.

Implementation of Opinion 1!
Potential improvement idea: Make it an array so that array values can be changed by user input
Starting state
    Print out a 3x3 # tower
    if there is no winner or a draw continue
    Take input from user 1
    print("User 1 Choose a number between 0 and 8:")
    user1 = input() 
    User 1 input will always turn a selected space into a X 
    If they chose 5 it will be 
    ###
    #X#
    ###
    If the object in the position spesisied isn't X or O then we can continue if not the user will try again
    Can't do else because they can miss the first one then go for the second one and it won't be checked
    # Show user1 input on the board
    for i in range(3):
        print("###") 
Victory condition
if match three then exit the loop
Need to check between users as well
XO#
#XO
##X
s[0]+s[1]+s[2]
s[3]+s[4]+s[5]
s[6]+s[7]+s[8]
Option 1 write a victory case for each option
Option 2 Winning strings: 0,4,8 - 2,4,6 - 2,5,8 - 0,1,2 - 3,4,5 - 6,7,8
